# MetalBeerSolid

Download the .rar file to demo the game. 

The image file contains an image of the first level, and the readme file that goes along with it explains my choices for the level layout. 


Contains several working iterations of my game "Metal Beer Solid".

The gameplay contains puzzle-like elements, with some platforming. You play as a beer can in a high-school settting out to save your 5 beer can friends from various rooms in the school.
