MetalBeerSolid_level.PNG contains an image of the first level from the game I made at my university called Metal Beer Solid.

The objective of the game is to save the beer can, whose location is indicated by the bright green arrow. 

It is currently frozen, and the table is too high to reach by just jumping.
The player must explore their surroundings and think of a way to get to the table. 
I wanted players to be able to see objects in the environment and think of a way to use them so I designed a few ways to reach the table.

There are 3 different ways to get on the table. 

1. Use a mentos on one of the desks (which allows you to increase your jump height. A mechanic introduced in the tutorial room just before this level).
2. Jump from window sill to window sill.
3. Knock over a trashcan to get on the white board then on to the table.

Once on the table the player must figure out how to melt the frozen beer can.

1. Get a magnet to drag the beer can to the heat lamp(pretend beer cans are magnetic).
2. Use salt to melt the ice.

Both of these are on the desks. The player usually sees them on the desks before getting to the frozen beer can table but if not, they are visible from on top of the table,
and the room has hints.
