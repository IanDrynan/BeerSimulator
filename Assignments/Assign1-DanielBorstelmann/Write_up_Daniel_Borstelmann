I built a game with a rolling mushroom that picks up game pieces and when you get a certain number, you win.
This is directly related to our project because having an inanimate object rolling around achieving goals to win is how our game will be implemented.
Swap out the mushroom for a beer can and make the goals more complicated and then you have our finished product.
As you roll the mushroom around, pick up all 15 objects and you win.
